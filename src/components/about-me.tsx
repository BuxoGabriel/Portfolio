            Hello! My name is Gabriel Buxo and I have been coding for over a decade and I am excited to be a part of your team.
            Javascript programmer since middle school. Always interested in learning more and aquiring new skills.
            I always strive to produce quality software and be a valuable and collaborative team member. 
            My passion for cs has led me to make countless apps and programs some of which are below with more to come!
